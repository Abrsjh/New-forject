# OpenBoard Development Plan

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup
1. **Create Vite project structure and package.json dependencies**
   - Set up Vite React TypeScript template structure
   - Define required dependencies (react, zustand, react-router-dom, tailwindcss, etc.)
   - Create proper folder structure (src/components, stores, data, types, utils)
   - Set up Tailwind CSS configuration

2. **Create TypeScript types and interfaces**
   - Define Channel, Message, User interfaces with proper typing
   - Create index.ts for type exports
   - Add utility types for state management
   - Include proper timestamp and ID typing

3. **Create mock data file with realistic content**
   - Generate diverse users with proper avatar URLs (using placeholder services)
   - Create meaningful channels (general, tech, random, announcements)
   - Generate sample messages with realistic content and proper timestamps
   - Ensure data relationships are consistent (users exist for all messages)

4. **Setup Zustand store with localStorage integration**
   - Create useAppStore with proper TypeScript typing
   - Implement theme persistence with localStorage utilities
   - Add actions for channel/message management with proper error handling
   - Include search functionality and UI state management

## Phase 2: Core Layout & Components
5. **Setup React Router and basic App structure**
   - Configure React Router with proper route definitions
   - Create App.tsx with router setup and theme provider
   - Implement route guards and 404 handling
   - Set up proper navigation between channels

6. **Create responsive Layout component with theme support**
   - Two-column layout with CSS Grid/Flexbox
   - Mobile-responsive with collapsible sidebar
   - Dark/light theme CSS custom properties
   - Proper semantic HTML and accessibility

7. **Build Sidebar component with channel list**
   - Display channels with lucide-react icons
   - Implement real-time search filtering
   - Show active channel highlighting
   - Mobile toggle and responsive behavior

8. **Implement MessageView component**
   - Display messages with user avatars and timestamps
   - Auto-scroll to latest message with smooth behavior
   - Responsive message layout with proper spacing
   - Empty state and loading states

## Phase 3: Interactivity & Features
9. **Create MessageComposer component**
   - Form for adding new messages with validation
   - Proper focus management and keyboard shortcuts
   - Integration with Zustand store actions
   - Character limits and input sanitization

10. **Implement ThemeToggle component**
    - Dark/light mode switcher with system preference detection
    - localStorage persistence with proper error handling
    - Smooth theme transitions with CSS variables
    - Accessibility compliance (proper labels, keyboard support)

11. **Add advanced search and filtering**
    - Real-time channel search with debouncing
    - Clear search functionality with keyboard shortcuts
    - Search highlighting and results management
    - Proper search state persistence

## Phase 4: Polish & Deployment Readiness
12. **Implement message timestamps and auto-scroll**
    - Relative timestamp formatting with date-fns
    - Auto-scroll to bottom on new messages
    - Scroll position management and smooth scrolling
    - Timestamp grouping for better UX

13. **Add error boundaries and loading states**
    - React error boundaries for component failures
    - Loading states for data operations
    - Proper error messaging and recovery
    - Fallback UI components

14. **Final optimizations and Vercel deployment prep**
    - Performance optimizations (React.memo, useMemo)
    - Bundle size analysis and optimization
    - Accessibility audit and improvements
    - Cross-browser testing and polyfills

## Testing Strategy
- Write tests for each component before implementation
- Test Zustand store actions and state updates
- Test routing and navigation
- Test localStorage persistence
- Test responsive design and mobile functionality
